### **AI Chatbot with NLP in Python**
An AI chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) can understand and respond to user queries intelligently. Python provides powerful libraries like **NLTK** and **spaCy** to process text data and generate human-like responses.

### **How It Works**
1. **Text Preprocessing**  
   The chatbot tokenizes and processes user input using NLP techniques.
   
2. **Pattern Matching**  
   Using `nltk.chat.util.Chat`, predefined patterns match user queries to generate responses.

3. **Conversation Handling**  
   The chatbot supports basic greetings, personal questions, and farewell messages.

### **Implementation**
- **NLTK**: Used for text processing and pattern-based response matching.
- **spaCy**: Enhances language understanding by analyzing sentence structure.

The chatbot script initializes, listens to user input, and responds accordingly. For better interaction, it can be integrated with advanced AI models like OpenAI's GPT.
